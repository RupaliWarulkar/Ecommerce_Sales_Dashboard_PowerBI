# Ecommerce_Sales_Dashboard_PowerBI
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Ecommerce sales data. It provides insights into sales, profit, orders, and shipping trends across different categories, segments, and regions, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

# Key Features of the Dashboard 
In this dashboard, I've integrated four key performance indicators (KPIs): **Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales, YTD Profit, YTD Quantity, and YTD Profit Ratio.** <br />
Each KPI offers insights into year-over-year sales, profit, quantity, and profit margin. Additionally, there are month-wise YTD sales represented as sparklines within each KPI. To meet client specifications, the dashboard includes six visuals.
